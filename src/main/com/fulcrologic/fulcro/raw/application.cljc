(defn fulcro-app
  "Create a new Fulcro application.

  This version creates an app that is not attached to React, and has no default root or optimized render.

  `options`: A map of initial options

   * `:initial-db` a *map* containing a *normalized* Fulcro app db.  Normally Fulcro will populate app state with
     your component tree's initial state.  Use `mount!` options to toggle the initial state pull from root.
   * `:optimized-render!` - A function that can analyze the state of the application and optimally refresh the screen.
     Defaults to `multiple-roots-renderer` (highly recommended), but other options are available in the rendering package.
     Further customizations are
     also possible.  Most applications will likely be best with the default. Standard Fulcro components are also pure
     (unless you supply `shouldComponentUpdate` to change that) to prevent rendering when props have not changed.
   * `default-result-action!` - A `(fn [env])` that will be used in your mutations defined with `defmutation` as the
     default `:result-action` when none is supplied. Normally defaults to a function that supports mutation joins, targeting,
     and ok/error actions. WARNING: Overriding this is for advanced users and can break important functionality. The
     default is value for this option is `com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations/default-result-action!`, which could be used
     as an element of your own custom implementation.
   * `:global-eql-transform` - A `(fn [AST] new-AST)` that will be asked to rewrite the AST of all transactions just
     before they are placed on the network layer.
   * `:client-will-mount` - A `(fn [app])` that is called after the application is fully initialized, but just before
   it mounts. This is triggered when you call `app/mount!`, but after all internals have been properly initialized.
   * `:client-did-mount` - A `(fn [app])` that is called when the application mounts the first time. WARNING: Due to
     the async nature of js and React this function is not guaranteed to be called after the application is
     completely on the DOM.  If you need that guarantee then consider using `:componentDidMount` on your application's
     root component.
   * `:remotes` - A map from remote name to a remote handler, which is defined as a map that contains at least
     a `:transmit!` key whose value is a `(fn [send-node])`. See `networking.http-remote`.
   * `:shared` - A (static) map of data that should be visible in all components through `comp/shared`.
   * `:shared-fn` - A function on root props that can select/augment shared whenever a forced root render
     or explicit call to `app/update-shared!` happens.
   * `:props-middleware` - A function that can add data to the 4th (optional) argument of
     `defsc`.  Useful for allowing users to quickly destructure extra data created by
     component extensions. See the fulcro-garden-css project on github for an example usage.
   * `:render-middleware` - A `(fn [this real-render])`. If supplied it will be called for every Fulcro component
     render, and *must* call (and return the result of) `real-render`.  This can be used to wrap the real render
     function in order to do things like measure performance, set dynamic vars, or augment the UI in arbitrary ways.
     `this` is the component being rendered.
   * `:remote-error?` - A `(fn [result] boolean)`. It can examine the network result and should only return
     true when the result is an error. The `result` will contain both a `:body` and `:status-code` when using
     the normal remotes.  The default version of this returns true if the status code isn't 200.
   * `:global-error-action` - A `(fn [env] ...)` that is run on any remote error (as defined by `remote-error?`).
   * `:load-mutation` - A symbol. Defines which mutation to use as an implementation of low-level load operations. See
     Developer's Guide
   * `:query-transform-default` - DEPRECATED. This will break things in unexpected ways. Prefer `:global-eql-transform`.
   * `:load-marker-default` - A default value to use for load markers. Defaults to false.
   * `:core-render!` - A (fn [app] side-effect) that is called by schedule render.
   * `:render-root!` - The function to call in order to render the root of your application. Defaults
     to `js/ReactDOM.render`.
   * `:hydrate-root!` - The function to call in order to hydrate the root of your application. Defaults
     to `js/ReactDOM.hydrate`.
   * `:unmount-root!` - The function to call in order to unmount the root of your application. Defaults
     to `js/ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode`.
   * `:root-class` - The component class that will be the root. This can be specified just with `mount!`, but
   giving it here allows you to do a number of tasks against the app before it is actually mounted. You can also use `app/set-root!`.
   * `:submit-transaction!` - A function to implement how to submit transactions. This allows you to override how transactions
     are processed in Fulcro.  Calls to `comp/transact!` will come through this algorithm.
   * `:abort-transaction!` - The function that can abort submitted transactions. Must be provided if you override
     `:submit-transaction!`, since the two are related."

  will be invoked, remote-error? will be used to decide if you consider that an error, etc.).
  The result map from an abort will include `{::txn/aborted? true}`, but will not include `:status-code` or `:body`.

  This function affects both started and non-started items in the send queues, but will not affect submissions that have not yet
  made it to the network processing layer (things still in top-level transaction submission queue).

  So the sequence of calls:

  ```
  (comp/transact! this `[(f)] {:abort-id :a})
  (app/abort! this :a)
  ```

  will cancel anything active with abort id `:a`, but since you've held the thread the entire time the submission of
  mutation `(f)` is still on the submission queue and will not be aborted.

  - `abort-id`: The abort ID of the operations to be aborted.
